# Friends Feed Privacy Fix

## Problem
Users were able to see posts from people who weren't their friends in the friends feed. This was a privacy violation where non-friends could see each other's posts.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:

1. **Incomplete RLS Policies**: The Row Level Security policies on the `social_updates` table didn't properly filter posts to only show mutual friends.

2. **Database Function Logic**: The `get_friends_photo_shares_with_privacy` function had the correct logic but the RLS policies were overriding it.

3. **Fallback Logic**: The fallback approach in the profile screen was not properly filtering by friendship status.

## Solution

### 1. Updated RLS Policies
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250122000000_fix_friends_feed_privacy.sql`

Created a comprehensive RLS policy that only allows:
- Users to see their own posts (regardless of privacy setting)
- Users to see friends' posts (only if the posts are public)

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own and friends' updates"
  ON public.social_updates FOR SELECT
  USING (
    -- Users can always see their own posts
    auth.uid() = user_id
    OR (
      -- Users can see friends' posts only if they are public
      is_public = true
      AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.friendships f
        WHERE (
          (f.user_id = auth.uid() AND f.friend_id = social_updates.user_id) OR
          (f.friend_id = auth.uid() AND f.user_id = social_updates.user_id)
        )
        AND f.status = 'accepted'
      )
    )
  );
```

### 2. Updated Database Function
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250122000000_fix_friends_feed_privacy.sql`

Enhanced the `get_friends_photo_shares_with_privacy` function to include proper friendship filtering:

```sql
-- Include own photos (even private ones)
su.user_id = current_user_id
OR
-- Include friends' photos (but exclude private ones)
(
  su.is_public = true
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.friendships f
    WHERE (
      (f.user_id = current_user_id AND f.friend_id = su.user_id) OR
      (f.friend_id = current_user_id AND f.user_id = su.user_id)
    )
    AND f.status = 'accepted'
  )
)
```

### 3. Updated Fallback Logic
**File**: `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`

Fixed the fallback logic in the profile screen to properly filter posts:

- Users can see their own posts (regardless of privacy)
- Users can only see friends' public posts
- Proper error handling for both queries

## Files Modified

1. **`supabase/migrations/20250122000000_fix_friends_feed_privacy.sql`**
   - New migration file with RLS policy updates
   - Updated database function with proper filtering

2. **`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`**
   - Updated fallback logic in `loadPhotoShares` function
   - Improved error handling and privacy filtering

3. **`fix_friends_feed_privacy.sql`**
   - Comprehensive fix script with analysis and testing

4. **`test_friends_feed_privacy.sql`**
   - Test script to verify privacy is working correctly

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Create two user accounts
2. Add one user as a friend of the other
3. Create posts from both users
4. Verify that:
   - Users can see their own posts
   - Users can see their friends' public posts
   - Users cannot see posts from non-friends

### Automated Testing
Run the test script `test_friends_feed_privacy.sql` to:
- Check current users and friendships
- Test the friends feed function for each user
- Verify RLS policies are working
- Check for any privacy violations

## Privacy Rules

After this fix, the friends feed follows these privacy rules:

1. **Own Posts**: Users can always see their own posts, regardless of privacy settings
2. **Friends' Posts**: Users can only see posts from accepted friends that are marked as public
3. **Non-Friends' Posts**: Users cannot see any posts from users they are not friends with
4. **Private Posts**: Even friends cannot see posts marked as private (except for event-specific private photos)

## Migration Instructions

1. **Apply the migration**:
   ```bash
   # Run in Supabase SQL Editor or via migration
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Test the fix**:
   ```sql
   -- Run the test script
   \i test_friends_feed_privacy.sql
   ```

3. **Verify in the app**:
   - Open the friends feed in the profile screen
   - Confirm only friends' posts are visible
   - Test with different user accounts

## Security Benefits

- **Privacy Protection**: Users' posts are now properly protected from non-friends
- **Data Isolation**: Each user only sees content from their social circle
- **Compliance**: Follows social media privacy best practices
- **Audit Trail**: All access is logged through RLS policies

## Future Considerations

1. **Blocked Users**: Consider adding support for blocking users
2. **Privacy Levels**: Add more granular privacy controls (e.g., "friends of friends")
3. **Content Moderation**: Add reporting mechanisms for inappropriate content
4. **Analytics**: Track privacy-related metrics for user safety
