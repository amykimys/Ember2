# App Reopen Fix Test Plan

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Session Expiration Handling
- ✅ Added automatic session refresh when expired
- ✅ Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Better error handling for session restoration

### 2. Race Conditions
- ✅ Prevented multiple simultaneous data refreshes
- ✅ Added debouncing for app state changes
- ✅ Improved data context state management

### 3. Network Connectivity
- ✅ Added network connectivity checks
- ✅ Retry logic for network failures
- ✅ Graceful handling of offline scenarios

### 4. Long Periods of Inactivity
- ✅ Track app inactivity time
- ✅ Force complete refresh after long inactivity
- ✅ Better session validation on app foreground

### 5. Data Consistency
- ✅ Improved error handling in data preloading
- ✅ Better state management in DataContext
- ✅ Prevented stale data issues

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Normal App Reopen
1. Open app and sign in
2. Close app completely
3. Reopen app after 5 minutes
4. **Expected**: App should load normally with fresh data

### Test 2: Long Period of Inactivity
1. Open app and sign in
2. Close app completely
3. Reopen app after 2+ hours
4. **Expected**: App should force complete data refresh

### Test 3: Network Issues
1. Open app and sign in
2. Turn off network connection
3. Close and reopen app
4. **Expected**: App should handle gracefully without crashing

### Test 4: Session Expiration
1. Open app and sign in
2. Wait for session to expire (or manually expire)
3. Close and reopen app
4. **Expected**: App should refresh session automatically

### Test 5: Multiple Rapid Opens
1. Open app and sign in
2. Rapidly close and reopen app multiple times
3. **Expected**: App should prevent race conditions and load properly

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced Session Management** (`app/_layout.tsx`)
   - Automatic session refresh on expiration
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Better error handling

2. **Improved Data Context** (`contexts/DataContext.tsx`)
   - Added refresh state tracking
   - Data staleness checking
   - Force refresh capabilities

3. **Network Utilities** (`utils/networkUtils.ts`)
   - Network connectivity checking
   - Retry with backoff
   - Debouncing and throttling
   - App inactivity tracking

4. **App State Handling** (`app/_layout.tsx`)
   - Better foreground/background handling
   - Long inactivity detection
   - Network-aware refresh logic

## Monitoring

The app now includes comprehensive logging for debugging:
- Session state changes
- Data refresh attempts
- Network connectivity status
- App state transitions
- Error conditions

Check console logs for detailed information about app behavior.
